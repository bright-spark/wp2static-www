WP2Static the software is over 10 years old - that's like 100 in human years!

It started as a tool to solve a problem for the ceator, [Leon Stafford](https://ljs.dev), while he was doing a lot of consulting work for internet marketers. It solved the problem then of serving a WordPress site fast on cheap, low-powered servers and without the headache of worrying about security and maintenance.

The importance of web security and performance has only increased over the years, which is why WP2Static is still relevant.

Development didn't really get serious until a couple of years ago, when remote deployment options were added, allowing WP2Static users to more easily deploy to static site hosting options like GitHub Pages and Dropbox (when they still supported static website hosting!).

### Name changes

Leon was working for marketers, but obviously not a marketer himself, when he named the first version "WordPress Static HTML Output Plugin"! Unfortunately, we can't change our plugin's "slug" on wordpress.org, so you'll still see this on the official plugin page and support forums there!

Naming shifted to WP Static Site Generator, as people were growing aware of what a static site generator actually was.

This was still a bit too technical and the aim was to help more users move to a better way of hosting their WordPress sites, so it was made a tad catchier with WP2Static. That name's short, memorable, descriptive and well-established, so unlikely to change again!

### Project missions

 - make quality software
 - reduce ineficiencies in web hosting industry
 - protect user's sites from security and performance issues
 - inspire/support a model of minimal-BS, sustainable open source projects

### Team

Day to day, it's currently just me, [Leon Stafford](https://ljs.dev). With low revenues and a preference to working alone, I like this and offers some benefits for moving quickly (at times!).

As the saying goes, though:

> If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

And that's so true, thanks to all of the project's [contributors](/contributors).
